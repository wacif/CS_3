# Lecture 19: Stages of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with APIs, NLTK, and spaCy


## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. In this lecture, we will explore three key components used in NLP workflows:

1. **APIs**: How they facilitate interaction with NLP services.
2. **NLTK**: A powerful Python library for linguistic data processing.
3. **spaCy**: A robust library designed for industrial-grade NLP tasks.

By the end of this lecture, you will understand the purpose, advantages, and basic usage of APIs, NLTK, and spaCy in NLP applications.

## Part 1: APIs

### What is an API?
- An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software systems to communicate.
- APIs act as intermediaries between clients and servers, enabling the consumption of services without exposing the inner workings.

### How APIs Apply to NLP
In NLP, APIs are often used to access powerful language models and services such as:
- **Translation Services**: Google Translate API.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Azure Text Analytics or IBM Watson APIs.
- **Speech Recognition**: Speech-to-text APIs like Google Speech API.
- **Text Generation**: OpenAI's GPT API.

### Advantages of Using APIs in NLP
1. **Scalability**: No need to host large models locally.
2. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies complex NLP tasks with straightforward calls.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Outsources computation-heavy tasks to cloud services.

## Part 2: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

### What is NLTK?
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** is an open-source Python library for processing and analyzing human language data.
- Designed for educational and research purposes, it provides tools for working with text data at multiple linguistic levels.

### Key Features of NLTK
1. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words or sentences.
2. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root forms.
3. **POS Tagging**: Assigning part-of-speech tags to words.
4. **Parsing**: Analyzing grammatical structures.
5. **Corpus Access**: Access to prebuilt datasets like WordNet and Gutenberg texts.

### Example: Using NLTK for Tokenization
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

# Tokenizing a sentence
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
text = "Natural Language Processing is fascinating."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

## Part 3: spaCy

### What is spaCy?
- **spaCy** is a high-performance Python library for industrial-grade NLP.
- Designed with speed and usability in mind, it is widely used in real-world applications.

### Key Features of spaCy
1. **Efficient Tokenization**: Fast and accurate breaking of text into tokens.
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies entities like names, dates, monetary values, etc.
3. **Dependency Parsing**: Analyzes syntactic relationships between words in a sentence.
4. **Pretrained Models**: Provides access to large pretrained language models tailored for various tasks.
5. **Custom Pipelines**: Enables building and integrating custom NLP workflows.

### Example: Using spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
```python
import spacy

# Load the spaCy language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Analyze text
doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion.")

# Extract entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```


Here’s a simple overview of the stages involved in NLP, along with examples of how these stages are handled by libraries like NLTK and spaCy, and how they can be exposed through APIs.

## 1. Text Acquisition

- **Description**: Collecting the text data you want to process.
- **Real-Life Example**: Gathering user reviews of a product on an e-commerce site for sentiment analysis.
- **APIs**: You might use a web scraping API or a social media API (e.g., Twitter API) to fetch tweets for analysis.

## 2. Preprocessing

- **Description**: Cleaning the text before further analysis, such as converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and dealing with special characters.
- **Real-Life Example**: Cleaning up customer feedback to remove emojis, hashtags, and URLs.
- **NLTK**: Functions like `re.sub()` (with regular expressions) and tokenizing text using `word_tokenize()`.
- **spaCy**: Built-in methods to handle whitespace, punctuation, etc.

## 3. Tokenization

- **Description**: Splitting text into smaller chunks (tokens), often words or sentences.
- **Real-Life Example**: Breaking a news article into separate words and sentences for topic classification.
- **NLTK**: `word_tokenize()` and `sent_tokenize()`.
- **spaCy**: Built-in tokenizer once you load a language model (e.g., `nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")`).

## 4. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

- **Description**: Labeling each token with its grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
- **Real-Life Example**: Highlighting all verbs in a legal contract to understand obligations or actions.
- **NLTK**: `pos_tag()` function.
- **spaCy**: Automatically tags POS when you process text (`doc = nlp("Your text here")`).

## 5. Lemmatization/Stemming

- **Description**: Converting words to their base or root form.
  - **Stemming**: Chops off word endings (e.g., “running” → “run”).
  - **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their dictionary form (e.g., “ran” → “run”).
- **Real-Life Example**: Grouping variations of a word together, like “playing,” “played,” and “plays,” so they’re counted as the same concept in an analysis.
- **NLTK**: `WordNetLemmatizer()`.
- **spaCy**: Lemmatization is automatic via language models.

## 6. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- **Description**: Identifying and classifying important elements (entities) in text—like people, organizations, locations.
- **Real-Life Example**: Automatically detecting person names in news articles to track mentions of politicians or celebrities.
- **spaCy**: Known for strong NER performance (`ent.label_`, `ent.text`).
- **NLTK**: Has an inbuilt `ne_chunk()` for entity detection.

## 7. Semantic Analysis & Applications

- **Description**: Understanding the meaning of text to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, summarization, or translation.
- **Real-Life Example**: Automatically determining if a restaurant review is positive or negative.
- **APIs**: Many companies provide NLP models as APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language API, Hugging Face Inference API). You send text to the endpoint, and it returns analyses like sentiment scores.

## Putting It All Together

1. **Collect text** (e.g., tweets via Twitter API).
2. **Preprocess and tokenize** (using NLTK, spaCy, or another library).
3. **Tag parts of speech and lemmatize** words to handle varied word forms.
4. **Identify entities** like names, places, or products.
5. **Analyze semantics** (e.g., for sentiment) and use results to make decisions, create summaries, or trigger actions.

NLP workflows can be embedded in applications through an **API**. For example, you could build a web service where the user sends a paragraph of text as input and receives a list of keywords, sentiment scores, and entities as output—behind the scenes, NLTK or spaCy does the heavy lifting.

These steps help businesses automate tasks such as customer feedback analysis, content moderation, and personalized content recommendations—making NLP an essential component of modern applications.
